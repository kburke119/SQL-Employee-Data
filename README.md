# sql-challenge

## Background
- Used the provided information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files.
- Added data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
- For the primary keys, verified if the column was unique. Otherwise, created a composite keyLinks to an external site., which takes two primary keys to uniquely identify a row.
- Create the tables in the correct order to handle the foreign keys.
- Imported each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table.
